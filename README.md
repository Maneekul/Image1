""" In the realm of image analysis, there are some cool tricks we can use. Object detection algorithms can help us identify and locate individual fish in an image, while image segmentation can be handy to distinguish whether they are swimming solo or in groups. As for determining their size, we might need a reference, like a known object of a certain size in the image. These techniques can significantly speed up the process and provide more accurate results than manually counting or separating each fish. Keep in mind, though, that getting it just right might take some tinkering with the algorithms and parameters."""
